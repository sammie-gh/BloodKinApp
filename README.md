Final year Project work

Medical crises emerge whenever or anyplace. During medical crises, a blood transfusion might be required to treat patients. The hospitals and clinics, particularly in our locales, discover that it is hard to get blood promptly, particularly of negative blood and rare types. The issue is increasingly serious when life is lost because of the inaccessibility of blood supply. To resolve this, few systems have been proposed by different Authors; wherein the blood donors contact information is kept up by a few organizations or blood donation centers. However, these solutions were not sufficient, as it provides a list of donors based on the static contact location of the donors, as provided during registration. Whereas in a real synopsis, the real area of the donor could be far from the patient's location. This thesis has proposed a system for dynamically locating the nearest donors for blood provisions. The system tracks the area of donors (volunteers) through the Global Position System (GPS) and provides the requestor or health centers to seek closest donors based on their exact location at the critical moment. This proposed system gives a solid technique for finding Blood patrons, particularly around the regions as to find where few blood banks or donors are available.
Blood Gift and Blood Transfusion Services (BTS) are crucial for protecting peopleâ€™s lives. Lately, global efforts have been initiated to utilize social media and smartphone applications to make the blood donation process more comfortable, offer additional services, and create communities around blood donation centers. Blood banks suffer a persistent shortage of blood; hence, advertisements are frequently seen on social networks and other media outlets urging healthy individuals to donate blood for patients who urgently require a blood transfusion.
This application helps people receive notifications on urgent blood donation calls, know their eligibility to give blood, search for the nearest blood center and donors, and present a certificate of participation. It also helps establish a blood donation community.
